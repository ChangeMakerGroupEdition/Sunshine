# Shine

A new Flutter mobile app for [Space App Sarawak competition](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/you-are-my-sunshine/details). 


The Earth intercepts a lot of solar power, 173 thousand terawatts, that’s ten thousand times more powerful than the earth’s population consumes. However, a lot of useful information associated with solar energy is not commonly known by the general public, especially homeowners. Hence, this is why we created SHINE, a mobile application that simplifies NASA’s data in a user-friendly dashboard that allows homeowners to easily gain access to meteorological data, monitor the electrical output, estimate future electrical savings, and so on. Our app aims to help homeowners in making better solar panel purchasing decisions and encourage more people to utilize solar energy to save our planet Earth.
